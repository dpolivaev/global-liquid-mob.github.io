# Global Liquid Mob

## The current thinking goes something like the this: 
**Hypothesis:** Mob programming, as a format, is very resilient and thrives on collaboration.

**Conclusion to be tested:** It is possible to construct a globe-spanning mob that maintains the fluid nature of single-piece work throughout multiple continuous 24 hour cycles by changing the makeup of the mob throughout each day in a structured way, generally “flowing" east-to-west in a non-stop and sustainable fashion.

A simplistic example of what is proposed has groups of between 2 an 3 people all participating from within 1 or more _neighboring_ time zone(s) identified as a single "group". They are separated by approximately 4-5 hours on either side from two simlar groups: one to the east, another to the west. Each group, in _their local_ morning, combine to mob with the group to _their_ east making what they view as a "morning" mob. The two groups function as one mob totalling 4-6 people.

In this simplistic case, each group takes a break at the midpoint of their day, after which they reform into an _afternoon_ mob, having left the group to their east and now joining with the group to their west, again seperated from them by approximatelt 4-5 time zones.

At all times, there is a functioning mob of roughly 4-6 people who have carried the code base further with each successive change. This will initially feel strange, because it is very new. If the same cycle repeats _each day_, it is expected it will become routine.

**Open questions**
There are many questions about the details: that, in part, is what the experiment is designed to surface. There are also some absolutes:
* at any given time a _“mob"_ consists of _at least_ four people, and not more than 6,
* actively working together on the _same thing_, 
* on _one computer at a time_, as the driver rotates.

The advantages of a global and fluid model is that _where_ those people are can vary widely _so long as_ certain minimally viable conditions can be met for all participants, _ideally_ continuously: 
1. a reliable computer connection, 
2. _minimally_, good voice connectivity, 
3. ideally, video connection that allows each participant to see all other participants, 
4. a mechanism that supports either easy transfer of control of the code being worked on, or, control of a single computer that is editing the code.
None of the above challenges are any different from remote pair programming. They are challenges with well-known solutions or remediations.

## The current focus
We are seeking participation from all hemispheres,
* .. from people already experienced with mob programming,
* .. who can commit to a _minimum_ participation of some number of days greater than 1,
* .. and are willing to share their eperiences freely.

More specifically, to be a viable experiment, we require a mix of developers and non-developers, men and women, from pretty much everywhere.
